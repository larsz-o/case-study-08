    description: [`This case shows how chaplains serve those who work in highly stressful occupations with sharply increased chances of being exposed to traumatic events. It portrays chaplains as part of a coordinated response effort that draws on the expertise of a number of fields, as well as offering gentle accompaniment that is not coercive. It suggests that even those who do not identify as religious in a “traditional” sense may have a strong spiritual reaction to traumatic events and thus come to view the spiritual component of their trauma as a significant issue to be addressed.`],
    objectives: [`Consider the dynamics of individuals experiencing traumatic events within cultures that discourage open display of negative emotions or seeking assistance to cope with difficult events`, `Illustrate how chaplains can participate in comprehensive response strategies that respect professional boundaries while also drawing on the strengths of multiple fields`,  `Illustrate how even comprehensive offerings like post-critical incident sessions should not be considered one-and-done solutions to traumatic experiences, but can instead serve as catalysts for seeking professional assistance, including spiritual care, when the effects of trauma are forced to the surface of an individual’s awareness`],
    themes: [`Emergency response academy students (e.g., police and fire) and trainees (e.g., EMTs)`, `Police command candidates`],
